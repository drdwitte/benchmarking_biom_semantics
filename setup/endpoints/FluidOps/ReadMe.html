		<a name="installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>
		
		<p>The Information Workbench supports both Windows and Linux based
			operating systems.</p>
				
		<a name="installation_windows"><h3>Windows</h3></a>
		
		<h4>Installation with the Windows Installer</h4>
		
		<p>Installing the Information Workbench on Windows can be done easily 
		using the Windows installer. During the installation one optionally
		can select to activate the bundled eDataCenterAnalyzer or eCloudManager App. 
		Note that the installation requires administrator privileges.</p> 
		<p>
			You can start/stop the application using the
			Windows <i>services</i> configuration tool (i.e.
			Start-&gt;Run-&gt;services.msc). The Information Workbench service is
			called <i>fluidOps Platform</i>.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Installation from the zip-distribution</h4>
		
		<p>
			It is recommended to use a 64bit Windows operating system with a
			64Bit Java SE Runtime Environment in version 1.8 (taken from the
			JDK). The reference version shipped with the installer is JRE SE <i>1.8.0_60
				64bit</i>. This is also the version used in steps a) and b) below.
		</p>
		<p>Unpack the distribution into a directory of your choice  
		(e.g. C:\IWB). In the following, we will refer to the absolute
		pathname of this directory by &lt;IWB_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt;.</p>
		
		<b>Running the Information Workbench as executable</b>
		<p>Execute <code>&lt;IWB_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt;/start.cmd</code></p>			
		

		<a name="installation_osx"><h3>Mac OS X</h3></a>
		<p>Please note that, while we have successfully installed and run Information Workbench on OS X,
		this platform is not officially supported.

		For OS X, we assume a manual mode of operation by a single user.
		This means that the software needs to be started and stopped manually from the terminal.
		Also, in case of multi-user systems, starting and stopping must always be performed by the same user who runs the installation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To run the Information Workbench on Mac OS X you need
		<ul>
		<li>A compatible version of the Java runtime  (ideally, version 1.8).
		OS X may ask you whether to install a Java runtime automatically if it detects that one is needed but missing.</li>
		<li>The distribution of the fluidOps Suite (.zip file).</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To get started, proceed as follows:
		<ul>
		<li>Unpack the distribution .zip file in a folder of your choice.
		<li>Open the terminal application and cd into the unpacked distribution (e.g., <code>cd Desktop/fluidOps-Suite</code> [ENTER])</li>
		<li>Run mac-install.sh as a shell script (<code>sh mac-install.sh</code> [ENTER])</li>
		<li>To start, type <code>./start.sh</code> [ENTER]</li>
		<li>After a few seconds, you should be able to access Information Workbench in you browser locally
		under the address <a href="https://localhost:50443">https://localhost:50443</a></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<a name="installation_linux"><h3>Linux</h3></a>

		<p>To run the Information Workbench under Linux a Java SE Runtime
			Environment version 1.8 (taken from the JDK) must be installed. Note
			that the Information Workbench does not ship a reference version
			bundled with the release.</p>
		<p>Unpack the distribution into a directory of your choice  
		(e.g. /opt/fluidOps/IWB). In the following, we will refer to the absolute
		pathname of this directory by &lt;IWB_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt;.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Download and install Java SE 64-Bit JDK version 1.8
				(<a
				href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>).</li>
			<li>Make sure the java command is added to the command-path of the user root.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Installing and Running as service</b>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a user under which the iwb shall run, e.g. "fluid" (in the following we will refer to this user as &lt;IWB_USER&gt;).</li>
			<li>Execute the script linux-install.sh in &lt;IWB_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt; as user root, like follows: 
			<br><code>bash -eu linux-install.sh &lt;IWB_USER&gt;</code>
			</li> 
		</ul>
		
		<p>This installs an init-script as <code>/etc/init.d/fops</code>, sets the ownership of the files to the user 
		&lt;IWB_USER&gt;, puts a file <code>fluidops</code> to the config folder <code>/etc/sysconfig/</code> (for 
		SUSE-like systems, <code>/etc/default</code> for debian-like systems and <code>/etc/</code> for others) that 
		holds system wide configuration parameters for the startup process and then starts the application.
		To make sure this script is executed on reboot create corresponding links in the run-level specific directories.
		Depending on your distribution, this can be done with: 
		<code>chkconfig -a fops</code> or with <code>insserv fops</code>
		
		<p>
		The application can be started with the following command:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Run <i>/etc/init.d/fops start</i></li>
		</ul>

		
		
		<h2><a name="upgrade">Upgrade Notes</a></h2>
		
		<p>The following listing contains noteworthy changes in the 7.1 release</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				It is recommended to use a recent Java 1.8 runtime environment to run
				an Information Workbench or eCloudManager installation. Particularly,
				various Java 8 JVM configuration settings are supplied to the JVM 
				(e.g. GC and Metaspace settings). Note that an appropriate Java 8 runtime
				environment is bundled with the Windows Installer already since a few releases.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the Web-Server the caching of static resources (e.g., images and 
				java scripts) has been increased from 1h to 24. In addition, all
				java scripts are now gzip compressed.
			</li>
			<li>
				The certificate used by the Jetty HTTP(s) webserver has been
				updated to use a stronger hash algorithm. Note that this is only
				applied in fresh installations as the keystore is copied over
				from the previous installation during upgrade. If no custom
				certificate is used, the keystore from <i>/etc/keystore</i>
				can simply be replaced with the new version.
			</li>
			<li>
				The default JVM memory is set to 5GB to adhere the requirements
				of common installations. If required, this value can be adjusted
				in the <i>backend-user.conf</i> file. Note that even if the OS
				does only offer less memory, the JVM has some intelligent behavior
				to deal with this.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<a name="getting_started"><h2>Opening the Information Workbench</h2></a>

		<p>
			Once the Information Workbench is running (startup may take up to a few minutes), it can be accessed at <b><a
				href="https://localhost:50443">https://localhost:50443</a>
			</b>. On the default start page you can find a tutorial with some first
			steps as well as links to important pages (such as the detailed user
			documentation).
		</p>

		<p>
			By default, an administrator account with credentials <b>admin/iwb</b>
			is created. It is highly recommended to change the password in the
			Admin area after the first login.
		</p>

		<h3>Shutting down the Information Workbench</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Windows Service:</b> Go to the Services configuration
				tool and stop the service</li>
			<li><b>Linux Daemon:</b> Invoke /etc/init.d/fops stop</li>
			<li><b>Commandline:</b> Exit the Information Workbench by
				clicking in the command line window and pressing Ctrl + c.</li>
			<li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Never exit the Information Workbench by
				closing the command line window without proper shutdown. This can
				result in corrupting the data store and loss of data.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Enabling HTTP</h3>
		
		<p>By default the system is configured to use the confidential mode (i.e. HTTPS):
		The application server will automatically redirect each request to the secure confidential HTTPS handler.</p>
		
		<p>Support for HTTP can be enabled by means of the system configuration setting "enableHttp".</p>
		
		<h3>Using the Information Workbench SDK in Eclipse</h3>
    
    	<p>Details about the fluidOps SDK can be found on the <i>Help:PlatformSDK</i> page in a running system.</p>

		<p>	<b>Where can I find additional information</b> </p>
		
		<p>The Information Workbench is configured to write logging output to <i>&lt;IWB_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt;/logs/</i>. 
		Runtime logs of the Information Workbench can be found in service.log, while output
		of the wrapper is written to <i>wrapper.log</i>. Please consider these files as a first source
		for further information. Note that the logging level can be configured in <i>&lt;IWB_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt;/etc/log4j.properties</i>.</p>
