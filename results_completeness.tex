In our SWAT4LS contribution~\cite{dewitte_swat4ls_2016} we discovered that query runtimes cannot be trusted without paying careful attention to query completeness. We revisited earlier results on WatDiv and discovered some inconsistencies as well.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Vir*\_Def:} Running Virtuoso with the \emph{Default} configurations gave it an advantage since in this setting the result count is limited to $100,000$. This only affects the \textbf{C3} queries for all sizes of WatDiv.
	\item \textbf{Vir*\_Opt:} \textbf{Bla1\_64\_Opt} was the only engine to correctly solve all \textbf{C3} templates. This query returns the highest number of results: 42,063,279. Although Virtuoso was configured to report an unlimited number of results, we discovered that for multiple independent queries the result count is limited to the magic number: 1,048,576. (which is $2^{20}$).  
\end{itemize}
As mentioned in the introduction of section~\ref{sec:tradeoffs} none of the runtime results reported so far are affected by this query incompleteness as we discarded all queries for which at least one store had a different number of results as compared to the consensus. In practice this means that all \textbf{C3} queries had to be discarded. The impact on the runtime comparisons is big as \textbf{C3} has the highest runtimes and ignoring query completeness would put Blazegraph at a serious disadvantage.
