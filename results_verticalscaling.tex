In the previous section we saw that the amount of memory is a critical parameter for benchmark performance. 
In this section we study the effect on the query runtimes of increasing the amount of memory to 64GB.
The two leftmost panels of Figure~\ref{fig:Fig02_WatdivVerticalScaling} study the effect of vertical scaling.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Memory is no magic solution:} Especially for \textbf{Gra1\_64\_Def} and \textbf{Vir1\_64\_Def} hardly any improvement can be seen. Blazegraph takes full advantage of the additional memory, with a large shift in both median and mean runtimes. The strong hardware dependence of Blazegraph could be a motivation to also study the performance in a GPU setting~\cite{blazegraphgpu}, which is outside the scope of this work.
	\item \textbf{Speedups:} \textbf{Bla1\_64\_Def} has a speedup of 8.4 for its average runtime and 3.1 for its median runtime. From the other stores only \textbf{ES1\_64\_Def} benefits with a speedup of 1.8 for its average runtime.
	\item \textbf{Benefits for fast queries:} The most outspoken positive effect is the lowering of the lower boundary of the box plots.

In the \emph{optimized} setting Blazegraph and GraphDB share second place. Virtuoso outperforms the other stores even in the 32GB, \emph{default} setup. Adding more memory doesn't impact its performance implying that it doesn't require extra resources. For GraphDB the effect of proper configuration is the most extreme, its performance strongly depends on turning on the correct indexes.}
